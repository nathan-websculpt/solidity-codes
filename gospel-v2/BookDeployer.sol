 * @notice BookDeployer will allow for multiple books (BookManager contracts) to be deployed (via deployBook function)
 * @dev this code is considered to be at version 0.0.2; note that 0.0.1 is at Optimism address: 0x29BB1313321dbA27Ad074DD6AD2943040319B439
 * 0.0.1 was a single book (Gospel of John) stored onto Optimism; however, 0.0.2 will allow multiple books to be bound together.
