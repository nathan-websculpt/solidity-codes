Memory instructions read and write to a chunk of memory. Memory expands linearly and can be read / written to arbitrarily.

- mstore stores a 32 byte (256 bit) word in memory.
- mstore8 stores a one byte (8 bit) word in memory.
- mload loads a 32 byte word from memory.



push1 0x01 // [1]
push1 0x00 // [0, 1]

// store one in memory starting at slot zero

mstore

push1 0x00 // [0]

// load from memory starting at slot one ... pushes value back onto the stack

mload      // [1]
